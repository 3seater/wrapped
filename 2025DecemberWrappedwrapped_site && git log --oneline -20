[33m039b8ba[m Switch back to Helius as primary - Cielo free tier limited to 100 txns
[33m63979b9[m Fix crash: Handle undefined token addresses in Cielo processing
[33m6bbc5d8[m MAJOR FIX: Switch to Cielo API as primary - Cielo handles USD1 perfectly
[33m31968c7[m CRITICAL FIX: Fetch ALL transaction types from Helius - Remove type=SWAP and type=TRANSFER filters - USD1 sells might have different transaction types - Increased pagination from 50 to 100 pages - Should now fetch SleepyTime sell transactions
[33m22622f0[m Add fetch and filter diagnostics - Show total transactions fetched from Helius - Show date range of fetched transactions - Show transactions filtered by 2025 filter - Sample of filtered OUT transactions - Will reveal if SleepyTime transactions being fetched or filtered
[33m6b99cbc[m Add aggressive fallback for USD1 sells with detailed logging - Check native balance change with detailed logs - Try absolute value if native change is negative - LAST RESORT: use solVolume for sells if nothing else works - Extensive logging to diagnose why sells not tracked - Should finally catch USD1 sell values
[33m845629c[m MAJOR FIX: Add USD1 stablecoin detection in tokenTransfers path - Detects USD1/USDC/USDT in tokenTransfers (not just tokenBalanceChanges) - USD1 sells: Token->USD1 (stays as USD1, no SOL back!) - Converts USD1 amount to SOL equivalent for PnL - Handles both USD1 buys (USD1 OUT) and sells (USD1 IN) - Should finally fix missing sell tracking for USD1-paired tokens - Works with 6-decimal stablecoins (USDC, USDT, PYUSD)
[33m0233a22[m Add detailed WSOL mint comparison logging - Show exact mint strings being compared - Show both expected and actual values - Show string lengths - Test trimmed comparison - Will reveal why WSOL not matching (whitespace, format, etc)
[33m12c541f[m Add comprehensive WSOL balance change logging - Shows if WSOL balance changes exist - Logs each token balance change with WSOL flag - Detailed logging when WSOL increases (sell) detected - Shows exact txTotalSolIn value being set - Should reveal why USD1 sell SOL not being tracked
[33mada22e4[m Add detailed address logging to diagnose USD1 sell issue
[33mcf8ad27[m Add detailed SOL tracking to tokenTransfers path - Log all native transfers with addresses - Show wallet address matching - Track maxNativeSolIn/Out calculation - Will show why SleepyTime sell not tracked (processed via tokenTransfers, not tokenBalanceChanges)
[33mbdf186e[m Add extensive sell tracking diagnostics - Log every native transfer with from/to addresses - Show if addresses match wallet - Log trade type detection (buy/sell/null) - Track sell processing step by step - Show if solIn is zero (main issue) - Will pinpoint exactly why sells not being tracked
[33mf8af04f[m Fix USD1-routed trades: prioritize actual SOL movement - Track native SOL IN/OUT directly (works for routed trades) - USD1 is just routing: SOL->USD1->Token or Token->USD1->SOL - Now detects final SOL movement regardless of USD1 intermediate - USD1 detection becomes fallback only if no SOL movement - Added comprehensive SOL tracking logs - Should fix missing sell values on USD1-paired tokens
[33mf8d51c0[m Add comprehensive transaction debugging - Log EVERY transaction to see if it's identified as a trade - Show transaction type, DEX program status, token activity - Debug tokenBalanceChanges presence and count - Will help identify why USD1 transactions not showing TX SCAN logs
[33m1d54909[m Add comprehensive stablecoin detection logging - Check BOTH tokenBalanceChanges and tokenTransfers - Enhanced logging with clear boundaries and status - Shows all tokens in transaction and marks stablecoins - Helps diagnose why USD1 sells not being detected
[33m2398c0a[m Fix stablecoin detection: support USDC/USDT/PYUSD with correct decimals - Support all major stablecoins (USDC, USDT, PYUSD) - Fix decimal conversion (6 decimals for stablecoins, not 9) - Add comprehensive logging to debug USD1 sell issues - Scan all token balance changes at transaction level - Log trade matching logic for debugging
[33mf55233b[m Fix USD1 sell detection - now scans transaction level first
[33mf3bb4ca[m Major fixes: 2025 filter, USD1 stablecoin support, improved token metadata - Filter PNL to 2025 only (not entire wallet history) - Full USD1/PYUSD stablecoin support for trades - Improved token metadata fetching: Added Jupiter API - Better token name and image fetching - Skip stablecoins (USDC, USDT, USD1) as traded tokens - Accurate PNL calculation for stablecoin-paired tokens
[33m3f85bef[m Fix text opacity in captures and update tweet format
